      <h1>Sourdough Scrambled Eggs</h1>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 Eggs</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Milk</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>2 grinds Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Butter</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Prepare a slice of sourdough which is approximately one index finger
          thick.
        </li>
        <li>
          Spread a thin layer of butter on both side of the sourdough, then
          toast both sides on a non stick skillet / cast iron pan until golden
          brown.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk eggs, milk, salt and pepper together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Melt butter over medium heat, then pour egg in.</li>
        <li>
          Wait 5 seconds, then start leisurely pushing the egg using a rubber /
          wooden spatula back and forth in long strokes, and all around the
          skillet edges, to push the set egg out of the way and let raw egg run
          onto the skillet to cook. After 30 seconds or so, start adding some
          folding action too.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook for 60 seconds in total until you have a pile of soft, custardy
          scrambled egg folds or "curds" and no raw egg leaking on the edges of
          the pile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Take it off the heat when it's still a bit undercooked for your taste.
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently fold the eggs for another 10 seconds as it will finish cooking
          with residual pan heat, then slide onto hot toasted crusty bread
          slathered with butter.
        </li>
      </ol>
