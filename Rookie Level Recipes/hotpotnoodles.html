      <li>
        Start by mixing up your sauce in a serving bowl. You can use any
        combination of sesame paste, soy sauce, sacha sauce, chinese vinegar,
        chili oil, garlic, scallions, cilantro, or any other ingredients you
        like. The ones I’ve listed here are only a suggested guideline, but if
        you have a favorite chili sauce or other condiment that you’d like to
        add, feel free!
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring a pot of water to a boil. Add the oil to the pot, and blanch your
        leafy greens for 30 seconds to a minute, depending on how tender they
        are.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the veggies from the water and transfer to your bowl. Then boil
        the noodles according to the package instructions and add to the bowl.
        Toss everything together, and enjoy!
